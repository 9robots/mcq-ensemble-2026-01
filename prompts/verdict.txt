# Purpose: Get the answer letter only, avoiding "formatting tax"
# The model uses its internal reasoning (xhigh, extended thinking, etc.)
# but only outputs a simple letter response.
#
# Usage: Append this suffix to the question (after stripping any existing
#        CoT instructions like "Think step-by-step...ANSWER: [letter]")
