DEBATE RESOLUTION

You have participated in a multi-round debate. Now review all arguments and select your final answer.

IMPORTANT:
- Ignore vote counts. The majority is often wrong on hard problems.
- Evaluate REASONING QUALITY only.
- Look for: correct use of evidence, valid inferences, identification of key assumptions.
- The correct answer is the one with the most rigorous argument, not the most supporters.
